> Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app. It allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

> Yeoman is language agnostic. It can generate projects in any language (Web, Java, Python, C#, etc.)

> Yeoman by itself doesn't make any decisions. Every decision is made by generators which are basically plugins in the Yeoman environment. There's a lot of publicly available generators and its easy to create a new one to match any workflow. Yeoman is always the right choice for your scaffolding needs.

> Here are some common use cases:

> Rapidly create a new project
- Create new sections of a project, like a new controller with unit tests
- Create modules or packages
- Bootstrapping new services
- Enforcing standards, best practices and style guides
- Promote new projects by letting users get started with a sample app
- Etc, etc
